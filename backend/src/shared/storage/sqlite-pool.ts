/**
 * SQLite Connection Pool
 *
 * The backend used to open a fresh `DatabaseSync` handle for each request that
 * touched SQLite. Under concurrent load that burns file handles, pays the
 * open + PRAGMA cost on every request, and — because each handle takes its own
 * write lock — serialises writes behind `SQLITE_BUSY` retries.
 *
 * This pool fixes both halves of that:
 *
 *  - **WAL mode.** Every pooled connection is opened in write-ahead-log mode,
 *    so readers no longer block the writer and the writer no longer blocks
 *    readers. This is the change that actually removes write serialisation.
 *  - **Connection reuse.** A bounded set of long-lived handles is shared by all
 *    callers, so file-handle usage is capped by pool size rather than by
 *    in-flight request count, and the per-request open cost disappears.
 *
 * `node:sqlite` is synchronous, so a pool does not buy parallel query
 * execution inside one process — the win is the removal of per-request setup
 * cost and the WAL locking mode, both of which dominate the P95 under load.
 * The acquire/release handshake is still enforced so a future async driver can
 * be swapped in without changing callers.
